IDEA:
	Dice Roller
		- 'shake' the board to roll
			- rolling ball sensor (input 1)
		- do little animation, after a short random delay show the number on 7seg display (output 1)
			- animation is running through states 10 -> 12 -> 11 from the 7 seg driver datasheet
		- one toggle button to switch between rolling a D6 and a D9 (input 2)
			- servo motor with a little arrow on the end to 'point' to which mode is active (output2)

	- uses the 7 seg driver IC from DGS because DO channels cant sink enough current to directly drive the LEDs
	- button as DI

	MOTOR:
		 GND    +5V  PWM
		BROWN   RED YELLOW

	TIMER:
		TCB: 1MHz
		DIV: 78
		TM : 8bit

	LabJack:
		0-7   - FIO0-FIO7
		8-15  - EIO0-EIO7
		16-19 - CIO0-CIO3

		Digital input: [2-5]V

	RB SENSOR:
		Max: 5V 1mA
		Min: 1V 10mA
		~2.5k ohm resistor to get 4V output (as per voltage divider)

	WEBSITE:
		- icons for each possible state
			- face of a die for each value
			- faces of a coin
		- row entry layout:
			[TIMESTAMP?] [ICON] - [MODE] [VALUE]
		- if i have time
			- add a statistic for how many times each value was rolled
